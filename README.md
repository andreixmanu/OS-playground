## fork()

*Necessary Libraries*

```c
#include <unistd.h>
```

*Description*
> Creates a child process from the parent process.
> The child process has pid 0, and has ppid of the parent process.
> Both child and parent process execute the whole program. 

*Usage*

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if(pid == 0)
    { // child process
        printf("[FIGLIO]\t%d\n", pid);
    } else if(pid < 0)
    { // fork error
        perror("Errore nella fork\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else
    { // parent process
       printf("[GENITORE]\t%d\n", pid);
    }

    // this is going to be executed by child and parent
    printf("[1]\t%d\n", pid);
    printf("[2]\t%d\n", pid);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## wait()

*Necessary Libraries*

```cpp
#include <wait.h>
```

*Description*

> Makes the parent process wait for the child process to finish its execution.
> It then resumes the parent process' execution.

*Usage*

```cpp
#include <time.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    pid_t pid = fork();
    int n;

    if(pid == 0)
    { //child process
        n = 1;
    } else
    { //parent process
        n = 6;
    }
    if(pid != 0) wait(NULL);
    
    for (int i = n; i < n + 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", i);
        fflush(stdout);
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

## pipe()

*Necessary Libraries*

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
```

*Description*

> Creates a pipe with a buffer memory, used to connect and pass
> data from 2 processes. Each pipe has 2 ends, one for reading from the stream,
> the other for writing on the stream. The pipe is an int array of 2 elements, one for 
> reading the content[0], the other one for writing[1]. pipe() returns 0 if the creation has been successful,
> -1 otherwise.

*Usage*

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int fd[2]; // file descriptor
    // fd[0] -> read
    // fd[1] -> write
    if(pipe(fd) == -1) perror("Pipe error\n");

    pid_t pid = fork();
    if(pid == 0)
    { // child process
        close(fd[0]); // close useless end of pipe
        int x;
        printf("Write the number: ");
        scanf(" %d", &x);
        write(fd[1], &x, sizeof(int)); // write data on the pipe
        close(fd[1]); // close the pipe after use
    } else
    {
        close(fd[1]); // close useless end of pipe
        int y;
        read(fd[0], &y, sizeof(int)); // read data from the pipe
        close(fd[0]); // close the pipe after use 
        printf("Value read: %d", y);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
<br>

*Complementary functions*


```cpp
write(int* pipe, void* buffer, size_t n);
```
Writes the *buffer* of *n* bytes in the pipe. 

<br>

```cpp
read(int* pipe, void* buffer, size_t n);
```
Reads the *buffer* of *n* bytes in the pipe. 

<br>

```cpp
close(int* pipe);
```
Closes the pipe on the selected end (1 for writing-end, 0 for reading-end).

*It's advised to close the ends that the process does not need. Every different 
process has its own pipe entrances. Closing one end in one process does not close
all the entrances to the pipe for the other processes.*

*It's advised to first create the pipe, and then fork the process, this way each
process will have the same pipe cloned from the previous code.*

## mkfifo()

*Necessary Libraries*

```cpp
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```

*Description*
> Creates a pipe file in the local path. The pipe can be opened by 
> any other process or program, and can be read or written. Use the previous
> pipe() commands to interact with the pipe.
> 
> If the pipe is opened in write-only or read-only mode, the program stops executing,
> waiting for another process to read or write the pipe.
> 
> If the pipe in opened in read and write mode, the program continues its execution.

*Usage*

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

#define FIFO_NAME "myFifo"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    if (mkfifo(FIFO_NAME, 0777) == -1) // creates a pipe file in the filesystem
    { // the pipe has permissions '0777' in octal value
        if (errno == EEXIST) 
            printf("FIFO '%s' already exists.\n", FIFO_NAME);
        else 
        {
            perror("Fifo creation error\n");
            return 1;
        }
    } else
        printf("FIFO '%s' created successfully.\n", FIFO_NAME);
    
    int fd = open(FIFO_NAME, O_WRONLY); 
    
    /* program waits here for a process that reads the pipe
    * use parameter "O_RDWR" to both read and write
    * use parameter "O_RDONLY" to only read the pipe file
    * use command "cat" on the pipe to read it
    */
    
    int x = 97;
    if(write(fd, &x, sizeof(x)) == -1) perror("Write error\n");
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
```

## Exercise

> In directory 'pipe_exercise' there is a little example of real usage of the pipes.
> 
> - 'write_pipe' writes the array on 'my_pipe'
> 
> - 'read_pipe' reads the array from 'my_pipe'
> 
> To execute the exercise, first execute write_pipe, then read_pipe.

## execlp()

*Necessary libraries*

```cpp
#include <unistd.h>
```

*Description*
> Executes a terminal command. If the function ends correctly, the program replaces its execution
> with the terminal command. There are many 'exec' variations, this option takes a (l)ist of arguments,
> and uses the (p)ath variables to run the commands. The function parameters must end with a NULL.
> It returns -1 if the execution of the command was not successful, otherwise the command is run and the 
> process is replaced. 

*Usage*

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <wait.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int pid = fork();
    if(pid == -1) exit(1);

    if(pid == 0)
    { // child process
         /* the function substitutes the whole program with this command
         * any code in the same scope after the function will not be executed
         * the function returns -1 if the command could not be found, and
         * keeps running the code underneath
         */
        int error = execlp("ping", "ping", "-c", "3", "google.con", NULL);
        if(error == -1) printf("Could not execute command\n");
        return 1;
    } else
    { // parent process
        int wstatus;
        wait(&wstatus);
        if(WIFEXITED(wstatus))
        {
            int status_code = WEXITSTATUS(wstatus);
            if(status_code == 0) printf("Code executed successfully\n");
            else printf("Code failed: error %d\n", status_code);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```
